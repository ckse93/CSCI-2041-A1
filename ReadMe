testing instruction 

It will work properly on OCaml ver 4.06.
open UTOP in Linux terminal and type #use "filename" where filename is the file you want to test. 
declare variables and call the function to test if it returns desired outcome.

Or, you can just use the Makefile by typing "make test-p1" through "make test-p3".
